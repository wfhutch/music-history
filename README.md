## Music History

This was an app at Nashville Software School that was designed to be continually evolving as new JavaScript methods and libraries were introduced.  At this point the instructions were to re-create a mockup of the app, add songs via two JSON files, and be able to delete songs.  In this version of the app the select elements and the checkboxes to filter songs by genre are not functional.
